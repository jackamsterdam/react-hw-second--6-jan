//btw we didnt need to check for null on start cause empty array.id is just undefined and undefined doesnt get displayed but when we displaying {} object we will need null chaining operator or conditional rednering or initizlie with an object in useState or {} as IEmployee also works

// hmm maybe better to call it e instead of employee naming is confisuing- name is same for employee propname and employee object also is called employee
